// A new cell is born on an empty square
if it is surrounded by exactly three occupied neighbor cells.
A cell dies of overcrowding if it is surrounded by four or more living neighbors,
and it dies of loneliness if it is surrounded by zero or one living neighbor.
A neighbor is an occupant of an adjacent square to the left,
right, top, or bottom or in a diagonal direction. Figure 16 below shows a cell and its neighbor cells.

for (int i = 0 ; i < row ; i++) {
  for ( int j = 0 ; j < col ; j++) {
    if ( i > 0) {
      if ( j > 0 ) {
          for ( int x = i - 1 ; x < i+1 < i ++ ){
            for (int y = j - 1 ; y < j+1 ; y ++ ) {
                if a[x][y] == 1
                  count ++ ;  } }

           if ( count == 3)
              a[i][j] = 1
          else if (count >= 4)
              a[i][j] = 0
          else if (count == 0 or 1)
              a[i][j] = 0

    }}}}
